Production Readiness & Engineering Best Practices

This document outlines important practices and infrastructure to ensure that backend services are reliable, observable, testable, and maintainable across the stack.

üî¨ Testing and Validation

1. Unit Tests

Coverage goal: Over 80% for core logic.

Use Jest (Node.js) or pytest (Python) for fast feedback.

Mock external dependencies such as Redis, Kafka, or databases.

2. Integration Tests

Validate real interactions between:

REST endpoints and services

Database/ORM layers (e.g., MikroORM, Postgres)

Kafka consumers

Use testcontainers or Docker Compose to spin up the full stack.
Run tests in CI/CD with seeded test data.

üìà Observability

1. Logging

Use structured logging libraries: Pino, Winston, or bunyan.

Log in JSON format with:

request_id, user_id, env, duration_ms, status

Use middleware to inject context.

Send logs to ELK, Datadog, or Loki.

Remove all console.log, console.error. Replace with logger.info, logger.warn, logger.error.

2. Metrics (Prometheus)

Expose /metrics endpoint including:

Request durations

Error counters

Kafka offsets / lag

Use prom-client (Node.js) or Prometheus exporters in Python.

Visualize with Grafana dashboards.

3. Tracing (OpenTelemetry)

Enable distributed tracing for:

REST handlers

Kafka consumers

DB queries

Export spans to Jaeger, Tempo, or Datadog APM.

‚ö†Ô∏è Alerts and Dashboards

Create Grafana dashboards and set alerts for:

P99 latency over threshold

Error rate > 5%

Kafka consumer lag

DB connection pool limits

Use Alertmanager or Datadog monitors for alert routing.

üß™ Local and Staging Practices

Use .env.local, .env.staging, and .env.production.

Run local mocks for Kafka with mock brokers.

Add health checks to validate dependencies.

Use NODE_ENV and LOG_LEVEL to toggle behavior.

üß† Debugging Discipline

Avoid:

Logging secrets or tokens

Leaving console.log in code

Do:

Use DEBUG=true to enable detailed logs

Use Chrome DevTools or --inspect for debugging Node.js

Use Python debuggers like pdb or debugpy

üîÑ Reliability and Resilience

Add retry logic with axios-retry or async-retry

Apply timeouts on all I/O calls

Use circuit breakers (e.g., opossum)

Handle:

Graceful shutdowns

Partial failures with fallback strategies

üìä Data Safety and Migrations

Use migration tools:

mikro-orm migration:up

alembic (Python)

Version and track migrations

Include rollback strategy

‚úÖ CI/CD and Quality Gates

Pre-commit hooks: eslint, prettier, black, flake8

CI Checks:

Type checking (tsc, mypy)

Unit and integration tests

Coverage threshold check

Linting pass

Use Snyk, SonarQube, or Bandit for static & security checks

üîê Security Hygiene

Input validation with zod, Joi, or Yup

Apply rate-limiting (Redis-backed leaky bucket)

Detect secrets using gitleaks or truffleHog

Set headers: CORS, CSP, helmet

üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Experience (DX)

Use monorepo tooling: Turborepo, Nx

Add IDE support for:

TypeScript auto-completion

Kafka schema registry plugins

Live reload with ts-node-dev, nodemon, watchgod, uvicorn --reload

üìÇ Extension and Inspection Service

Extension Code Overview

Captures PDF file uploads using content.js

Sends file as base64 or ArrayBuffer to the backend via chrome.runtime.connect

Listens for inspection results and logs them

Backend Service Overview

FastAPI or Express server

Accepts PDF via /inspect endpoint

Processes file (e.g., scans for secrets)

Returns JSON result

README

How to Use

Load the extension in Chrome using "Load Unpacked"

Upload a PDF file in ChatGPT or any matching domain

Backend must run at localhost:8000/inspect

Logs will show in DevTools and background

Limitations

Chrome extensions cannot bypass CORS when calling localhost from background.js

Extension only matches certain domains (e.g., openai.com)

Context invalidation can occur on page unload

Production Requirements

Deploy inspection backend behind reverse proxy with proper CORS headers

Use authentication and API rate-limiting

Handle file size limits securely

Avoid relying on client-side JS for sensitive validations

Performance Improvements

Stream PDF uploads instead of base64 encoding

Use a queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to offload inspection

Use Web Workers in content script for better perf

Add browser-level caching or heuristics to skip duplicate files

This checklist should evolve based on team maturity, stack, and deployment strategy.
